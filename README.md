# Online Transaction Fraud Detection using Backlogging on E-Commerce Website

* In this, we implemented Fraud Detection System (FDS) using Behavior and Location Analysis (BLA) to detect a payment fraud. FDS verifies whether the transaction is genuine or not. User spending patterns and geographical location is used to verify the identity. If any unusual pattern is detected, payment is declined.
* For location analysis, we utilised [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/). To obtain the location, we must utilise the ipinfo.io access token.
